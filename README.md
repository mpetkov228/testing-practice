# Testing Practice

## TDD Practice with Jest

Here I've written several functions employing TDD and the Jest testing framework.

### capitalize
- takes a string and returns the first character capitalized.

### reverseString
- takes a string and returns it reversed.

### calculator
- an object containing basic operations functions (add, subtract, divide, multiply).

### caesarCipher
- takes a string and a shift factor and returns string with each character "shifted".

### analyzeArray
- takes an array and returns object with following properties: average, min, max and length.
